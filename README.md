## Dataset chosen and reason to choose

We choose the dataset (2023-06-06 - Energy Data) for the first project. We chose this dataset as it has a wide range of data, and the correlation between features in the dataset is very intriguing to investigate. Furthermore, this is extremely relevant to the current global landscape, focused on energy consumption, emissions, and their implications by individuals, institutions, and governments worldwide.

## Brief introduction and dimensions of the dataset

This dataset is collected from Our World in Data. It contains data on energy consumption, energy mix, electricity mix of different countries over years.

The relevant dimension in the datasets are:
- Country: The country of interest
- Year: Year of observation
- Population: Population of that country
- GDP: Total Gross Domestic Product of a country
- Biofuel/Coal/Fossil Fuel/gas/Hydro/Low Carbon/Nuclear/Oil/Solar/Wind etc. -> share of energy consumption/electricity generation/per capita generation/ etc. : Data on specific type of energy on specific metric.

## Two questions to be answered:
- What are the patterns and comparisons in electricity generation among the top 5 countries by energy consumption/electricity generation/GDP and globally in 2023? How do these patterns differ between developed and developing countries or across continents?
  
- How has Vietnam's energy generation evolved over the past decade, particularly in terms of renewable versus non-renewable sources? How does Vietnam's energy consumption and efficiency compare to regional and global averages?

## Plans for answering each question
**Question 1**: To answer this, we will utilize stacked bar charts to illustrate the composition of electricity generation for each country. Additionally, countries will be categorized as developed or developing and grouped by continent to provide richer comparative insights.

**Question 2**: To answer this, we will create line charts to show the trend of renewable versus non-renewable energy generation over time, offering a clear visual representation of shifts in energy sourcing. Furthermore, Vietnam's data will be contextualized with regional and global averages, enhancing the meaningfulness of the findings through data analysis.
